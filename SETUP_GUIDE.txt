DS COLLAR - QUICK SETUP GUIDE FOR PLAY

================================================================================
WHAT IS THIS?
================================================================================

This is a wearable collar for Second Life that allows someone to take control
of your avatar during play. The person who controls the collar (called the
owner) can lead you around with a leash, lock the collar on you, restrict what
you can do, and more.

The collar is designed to be safe. You can always get out of restrictions using
the emergency menu, even if the owner has locked everything down.


================================================================================
BEFORE YOU START
================================================================================

What you will need:

1. A collar object in Second Life with all the collar scripts installed
2. The name of the person who will be your owner
3. A Second Life viewer that supports restrictions (Firestorm is recommended)

Important: Make sure you trust the person you are giving control to. This
collar can restrict your ability to move, talk, and use your inventory during
play.


================================================================================
STEP 1: WEAR THE COLLAR
================================================================================

1. Find the collar object in your inventory
2. Right-click the collar and choose "Wear" or "Add"
3. The collar will appear on your avatar
4. Wait a few seconds for all the scripts to start up
5. Touch the collar - you should see a menu appear


================================================================================
STEP 2: SET YOUR OWNER
================================================================================

This step gives someone else control of your collar.

1. Touch the collar to open the menu
2. Select "Settings"
3. Select "Owner"
4. Select "Set Owner"
5. Type the name of the person who will own you in chat
6. Confirm the selection when asked

Once this is done, your owner will have full control of the collar. They can
now use the collar menu and control your avatar.

Note: If you want more than one owner, ask your primary owner to add additional
owners through the "Multi Owner" option.


================================================================================
STEP 3: BASIC SETTINGS FOR PLAY
================================================================================

These settings control how the collar works. Your owner can change these, but
you should discuss them together first.

LOCK THE COLLAR
- Touch collar, select "Lock/Unlock"
- When locked, you cannot remove the collar without permission
- This requires a compatible viewer to work properly

PUBLIC ACCESS
- Touch collar, select "Settings", then "Public Access"
- When OFF: Only your owner and people they approve can use the collar
- When ON: Anyone can see your collar status and use some basic features
- Recommended: Keep this OFF for private play

ALLOW OTHERS TO CONTROL YOU
- Touch collar, select "Settings", then "Relay"
- This lets furniture and other objects control your avatar
- Options:
  * OFF - No outside control
  * ON - Outside control allowed, you can use your safeword
  * HARDCORE - Outside control allowed, you cannot use your safeword
- Recommended: Start with OFF until you understand how this works


================================================================================
STEP 4: HOW TO USE THE LEASH
================================================================================

The leash makes your avatar follow another person or stay in one spot.

TO START A LEASH (Owner does this):
1. Touch the collar (or use the remote control)
2. Select "Leash"
3. Choose who or what to leash to:
   - "Avatar" - Follow a specific person
   - "Post" - Stay anchored to your current location
   - "Coffle" - Chain multiple collars together

TO ADJUST THE LEASH (Owner does this):
1. While leashed, touch the collar
2. Select "Leash"
3. Choose "Length" to make the leash longer or shorter (1 to 20 steps)
4. Choose "Yank" to pull the wearer closer

TO END THE LEASH:
1. Touch the collar
2. Select "Leash"
3. Select "Unleash"


================================================================================
STEP 5: UNDERSTANDING RESTRICTIONS
================================================================================

Your owner can restrict what you can do in Second Life. These restrictions
only work if you have a compatible viewer.

Common restrictions include:

INVENTORY
- Prevents you from removing clothes or attachments
- Prevents you from adding new items
- Prevents you from accessing your inventory

TALKING
- Prevents you from using regular chat
- Prevents you from sending instant messages
- May redirect your speech to emotes only

MOVEMENT
- Prevents you from teleporting away
- Prevents you from sitting or standing
- Prevents you from going to certain places

OTHER
- Prevents you from editing objects
- Prevents you from creating objects
- Prevents you from touching things

Your owner controls these through the collar menu under "Restrictions".


================================================================================
EMERGENCY: HOW TO ESCAPE
================================================================================

VERY IMPORTANT - READ THIS CAREFULLY

If you need to escape all restrictions immediately:

1. TOUCH AND HOLD the collar for 2 seconds (long press)
2. This opens the EMERGENCY MENU
3. Select one of these options:
   - "Unleash" - Removes the leash immediately
   - "Clear RLV" - Removes all restrictions immediately
   - "Clear Relay" - Stops outside objects from controlling you

This emergency menu ALWAYS works, no matter what restrictions are active.
Your owner CANNOT disable this menu. It is your safety escape at all times.

If the emergency menu does not work:
1. Remove the collar from your avatar manually
2. If you cannot remove it, restart your viewer
3. Contact the collar maker for help


================================================================================
STEP 6: OTHER FEATURES TO EXPLORE
================================================================================

Once you are comfortable with basic play, you and your owner can explore:

BELL
- Makes a sound when you move
- Can be turned on or off
- Can adjust volume

ANIMATIONS
- Plays poses and animations on your avatar
- Owner can start and stop animations
- Automatically finds animations in the collar

TRUSTED PEOPLE
- Owner can add people as "trustees"
- Trustees have some control but cannot change major settings
- Good for friends or secondary partners

BLOCKED PEOPLE
- Owner can block specific people from using the collar
- Blocked people cannot see status or interact at all


================================================================================
TIPS FOR SAFE AND FUN PLAY
================================================================================

1. DISCUSS LIMITS FIRST
   Talk with your owner about what you are comfortable with before playing.
   Decide on boundaries and what restrictions are okay to use.

2. AGREE ON A SAFEWORD
   Even though the emergency menu always works, agree on a word or phrase
   that means "stop everything right now."

3. START SLOWLY
   Try simple things first (like the leash) before using heavy restrictions.
   Get comfortable with how the collar works.

4. TEST THE EMERGENCY MENU
   Before doing serious play, practice using the emergency menu so you know
   it works and you know how to access it.

5. KEEP COMMUNICATION OPEN
   Talk during and after play. If something does not feel right, speak up.

6. UNDERSTAND TPE MODE
   There is a special TPE Mode that removes all your access to the collar
   menu. Only use this if you completely trust your owner. You will only
   have the emergency menu in this mode.

TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

PROBLEM: I touch the collar but no menu appears
- Wait 10 seconds and try again (scripts may still be starting)
- Make sure you are the wearer or the owner
- Try touching and holding for 2 seconds for the emergency menu

PROBLEM: The leash does not make me follow
- Make sure you have a compatible viewer with restrictions enabled
- The leash works better with restrictions enabled, but can work without them
- Your owner may need to use a shorter leash length

PROBLEM: Restrictions are not working
- You need a compatible viewer (Firestorm recommended)
- You must have RLV enabled in your viewer
- In Firestorm: Click "Avatar" menu, then "Preferences", then look for
  the RLV option and make sure it is turned on

PROBLEM: I cannot set an owner
- Make sure you are the wearer of the collar
- Make sure you do not already have an owner (release first if needed)
- Type the owner's name exactly as it appears in Second Life

PROBLEM: The collar is not responding at all
- Remove the collar and wear it again
- If that does not work, check that all scripts are running (edit collar,
  go to Contents tab, look for script names)
- Contact the collar maker for help
